# Organogram

A short exercise to prove to myself I still remember anything about recursion and tree data structure.

## Scenario
* companies_data.csv file contains organisation contact information in no particular order
* first column is the row ID, a unique sequence number assigned to the row
* second column links the row to its parent record within the file, which may in turn link to another record, and so on...

## Objective
* print an 'organogram' in a hierarchical view
* code should be able to print to n-level depth
